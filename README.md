Frame differencing method: Automatic extraction of movement from video data

This frame-differencing method (FDM) automatically extracts movement from video data by detecting changes in pixels across frames. Currently, this FDM runs through MATLAB.

For more information on the FDM, see "Frame differencing methods for measuring bodily synchrony in conversation" (Paxton & Dale, 2013, Behavior Research Methods).
