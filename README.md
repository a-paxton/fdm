# Frame-differencing method: Automatic extraction of movement from video data

This frame-differencing method (FDM) automatically extracts movement from video data by detecting changes in pixels across frames. Currently, this FDM runs exclusively through MATLAB.

## More Information
For more information on the FDM, see "Frame-differencing methods for measuring bodily synchrony in conversation" (Paxton & Dale, 2013, *Behavior Research Methods*).
